Instructions
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

In this segment, we will be importing the necessary file into our database and extracting information from it to assist the editors of Eat Safe, Love magazine on where to focus their future articles. The following programs found in this repository will be conducting three different functions: setting up the database and jupyter notebook, updating the database, and an exploratory analysis. This is all down to answer the following questions:

Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
